## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Smart Voting System team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
- **Primary Contact**: sukesh2294@gmail.com
- **Secondary Contact**: sudhanshujii78@gmail.com

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability

- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies based on severity (see below)

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
|----------|---------------|--------------|

| Low | 1 week | 60 days |

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implement proper file upload validation

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use strong password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Implement proper session management
   - Follow principle of least privilege

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper access controls

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Security**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use HTTPS/TLS in production
   - Implement proper firewall rules

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Limit database access
   - Regular database backups
   - Encrypt sensitive database fields

3. **Server Security**
   - Keep OS and software updated
   - Use non-root user for application
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring
   - Regular security audits

## Known Security Considerations

### Face Recognition Data
- Face encodings are stored encrypted
- Original images are not stored after processing
- Face data is only used for authentication

### Email Security
- OTP codes expire after 10 minutes
- OTP codes are single-use only
- Email verification prevents unauthorized access

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
- Minimum password requirements enforced
- No plain text password storage

### Session Security
- Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Secure session tokens
- Proper session invalidation on logout

## Security Features

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Email verification required
- Face recognition authentication
- Password-based authentication

### Data Encryption
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Face encoding encryption
- Secure session management

### Input Validation
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload validation
- CSRF protection

### Rate Limiting
- Failed login attempt limiting
- OTP request limiting
- File upload rate limiting
